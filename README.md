OOP Parking Garage
# python-project2

Deven created the core repository and created the class. He also created the takeTicket and payforParking classes as well. Brittany created the leavingGarage classes section as well. Also, want to thank Brenden and Sarah for helping us with this assignment over the weekend to help boost our understanding of python.
